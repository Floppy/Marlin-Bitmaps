# Marlin Bitmaps

[Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) lets you add custom graphics for your 3d printer's boot and status screens. You can generate your own using the [online conversion tool](https://marlinfw.org/tools/u8glib/converter.html), but where can you find ones that people have already made?

This repository is an attempt to create an archive of boot and status graphics for use with Marlin.
